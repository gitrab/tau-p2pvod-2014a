====================================================

	StreamWatcher.py
	===============
	[*] the DFS was calculated wrong, some pieces were counted twice!
	[*] if the client is 'verbose' (last one) it does not kill the rest. instead each client terminates when done independently.
	[*] saves all statistics into memory and writing the CSV at the end
	
	run_wrapper.sh (NEW)
	==================
	[+] runs a command and checks it's exit code. if not success calls 'run_all.sh fail' to fail the entire test.
	
	run_test_check.sh \ run_run_check.sh  (NEW)
	===================================
	[+] check if a specific test\run is corrupted
	
	run_multipile.sh
	============
	[+] checks the exit code of 'run_all' and if the test failed another one is executed.
	[+] runs 'run_run_check.sh' to make sure that the run was ended successfully
	
	run_all.sh
	========
	[+] run all vod peers with 'run_wrapper.sh'
	[+] waits until all vod-peers processes exit
	[+] returning the test result in the exit code.
	[+] added an 'fail' parameter to indicate that the test has been failed
	[-] remove 'stop' parameter. unnecessary.
	
	run_scenario_vod.sh
	================
	[+] runs the tracker, the seeders and peers with 'run_wrapper.sh'
	[+] echos the amount of processes killed (kill&stop modes)
